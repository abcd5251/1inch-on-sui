# 1inch on Sui: ETHGlobal Unite Hackathon

This project is built for the [ETHGlobal Unite Hackathon's 1inch challenge](https://ethglobal.com/events/unite/prizes/1inch). The primary goal is to expand the reach of 1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+) to the Sui blockchain.


## 🎯 Project Goals & Requirements

This project aims to meet the qualifications for the 1inch prize by implementing a cross-chain swap solution between Ethereum and Sui.

### Qualification Requirements
- **Preserve Hashlock and Timelock Functionality**: The non-EVM implementation (Sui) must include hashlock and timelock mechanisms.
- **Bidirectional Swaps**: The swap functionality must work both ways (from Ethereum to Sui and from Sui to Ethereum).
- **On-Chain Demo**: The final demonstration must show on-chain (mainnet or testnet) execution of token transfers.
- **EVM and Sui Move Contracts**: This monorepo is structured to eventually contain both the EVM and Sui Move contracts required for the full end-to-end solution.

### Stretch Goals
- **UI**: While a functional UI is a stretch goal, this Next.js application provides an interface to demonstrate the swap functionality.
